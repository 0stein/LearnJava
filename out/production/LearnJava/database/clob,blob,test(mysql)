TEXT is a data-type for text based input.
On the other hand, you have BLOB and CLOB which are more suitable for data storage (images, etc) due to their larger capacity limits (4GB for example).
As for the difference between BLOB and CLOB, I believe CLOB has character encoding associated with it, which implies it can be suited well for very large amounts of text.
BLOB and CLOB data can take a long time to retrieve, relative to how quick data from a TEXT field can be retrieved. So, use only what you need.
